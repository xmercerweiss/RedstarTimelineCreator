# Redstar Timeline Creator
An open-source desktop application for creating visual timelines, written in Java. GUI created using Swing.

This is an old project I wrote in April of 2022. It was my first real Java project, and to-date is probably one of my most extensive projects. 

I've unfortunately lost the original source files; I've transferred my backups between many media multiple times, and I guess the contents of the source didn't make it. Luckily an in-tact JAR file _did_ make it, and the project remains functional. I leave this here as a testament to my burgeoning career as a programmer.

Thank you for reading! Feel free to use this project for whatever you'd like. If you want to reach out to me, give a holler at mercerweissx@gmail.com.
